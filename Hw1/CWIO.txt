Completed
create nodes 
WIP 
Figure out how to import other files into eachother
Figure out how to create the Stacks and Queues 


IDEAS
Count the ammount of letters in each line,
then only check for the letters in that for palindrominess
Once completed, go to the new line 

I'm pretty sure I make a class for the Node, which extends to Stack and Queue.

OTHER
I couldn't get C++ to run on my computer after trying for like a week. 
Had to abaondon ship tonight a swap to java.
I'll talk about it more during my write up

I Under stand how stacks and queues work conceptually, I just can't figure out how to get them to work with a node class
