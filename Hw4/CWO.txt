I think DFT and BFT might have eluded me with how I set up my Neighbor List. I Think I'd have to redo like 90% of this to make it happen
and its too late at this point to restart

OH my lord did ADJ and Matrixs take longer than I wanted them too, but they look super clean!
I know Its probably on the sloppy side to have a LL class and a LO class sepperate, but currently having them together doesn't sound fun
Added an inventory Check function to list the array (Should of make this ages ago)
