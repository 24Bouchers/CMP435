Adding edges 
Debug Adding edges

WIP
Spcies is almost working!

NOTES
I Don't know why the Spice program is ignoring red and green
The way I'm reading these commands is kinda jank. but.... it works for the purposes of this so ill take it. Currently works as long as
no vertex is a 10 or higher so I'll fix that when I add edges
